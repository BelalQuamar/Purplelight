Purplelight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. At it's heart, Purplelight provides a minimalistic web-based application that allows users to:

  * Signup/Login with Google, Office365, or through the application itself.
  * Manage your account settings and user preferences.
  * Create and manage your own personal rooms ([BigBlueButton](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) sessions).
  * Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
  * View recordings and share them with others.

Purplelight is also completely configurable. This means you can turn on/off features to make Purplelight fit your specific use case. For more information on Purplelight and its features, see our [documentation](https://github.com/BelalQuamar/Purplelight/wiki).

## Installation on a BigBlueButton Server

Purplelight is designed to work on a [BigBlueButton 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) (or later) server.

For information on installing Purplelight, checkout our [Installing Purplelight on a BigBlueButton Server](https://github.com/BelalQuamar/Purplelight/wiki#installing-on-a-bigbluebutton-server) documentation.

## Source Code & Contributing

Purplelight is built using php . Many developers already know php well, and we wanted to create both a full front-end to BigBlueButton but also a reference implementation of how to fully leverage the [BigBlueButton API](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html).

We invite you to build upon Purplelight and help make it better. See [Contributing to BigBlueButton](https://github.com/BelalQuamar/Purplelight/wiki#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

We invite your feedback, questions, and suggests about Purplelight too. Please post them to the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev).
